# Booking for Hotel romms

Develop an application for booking Hotel rooms.The application is destined 
to be used for booking purposes. The user will have the opportunity 
to browse from a list of hotels, and book one for a certain period of time. 
The user has full control over the booking, so the user can edit the period 
of time or even delete it. In order to use the application, 
the user will have to register first (will make an account).

In offline mode (The application will contain 2 main windows):
* The first window, the user can see a list of hotels, 
from which he/she can book one.
* The second window will contain the list of his/hers bookings, from 
which he/she can edit/delete a booking.
